Physical inactivity has consistently been shown to be one of the most powerful, modifiable risk factors for all causes of death and disease, alongside smoking and obesity. This interactive body map brings together scientific evidence on the links between lack of physical activity and disease. To use the map, click on any of the coloured dots on the body, or choose a specific disease from the dropdown menu. You can also filter by disease or condition type. This is the first in our package on the benefits of exercise.
